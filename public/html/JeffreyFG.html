                        Hello, thank you for coming to my website, My name is Jeffrey Fulmer Gardner. 
                        I am a San Francisco Native with a passion for software development. 
                        I have been developing my software development skills for years by first Attending CCSF where 
                        I got my associates degree in computer Science. I am currently attending SFSU in pursuit of a 
                        Bachelors in computer science. I wanted to create this site so that I could fill that section on 
                        job applications and have a page of my own to show off my computer programing skills. This site is 
                        built on express and Nodejs is hosted by me. From hardware configuration to final website, I have 
                        created this with my own skills. I will continue to add features and improve the look of my website 
                        over time.
